# University Folder Creation Tool
This is a simple program to quickly set up an organised university semester folder structure. After providing details such as degree name, courses, and number of weeks, it automatically creates a structured set of directories in your OneDrive or another specified location. 
Each course folder includes subfolders for every week of the semester, making it contextually easy to store and access course materials.

## Folder Structure

Below is an example of the folder structure format that the tool creates:

```
Year - Degree - Major (Semester)
└── Course Code - Course Name
    ├── Week 01
    ├── Week 02
    ├── Week 03
    ├── Week 04
    ├── Week 05
    ├── Week 06
    ├── Week 07
    ├── Week 08
    ├── Week 09
    ├── Week 10
     ...
    ├── Week x
```
